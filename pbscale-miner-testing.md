# Test plan
## Team Introduction
Our team is called Xinji Rongwei, base in Chengdu, China. We have already deployed six IDCs distributed in Chengdu, Xian, Wuhan, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, with different Networking Operators. Configuring 3PB+ storage pool for each IDC, high-performance CPU of Intel,378GB RAM, and 10 Gigabit networking. We will also add new high-performance servers to achieve the optimal configurations and maximum efficiency of the cluster.

We currently have a team of 12 people including R & D, hardware and software engineering and maintenance personnel for Filecoin.
So, we have adequate resources to participate in the PB-scale miner test, And we are willing to provide real valuable testing data.
## Power validation(testnet2,todo) 
## Test list
- Benchmarking
  - CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD and HDDs, also including Switches
  - Different hardware configurations(it has been determined that 4 CPUs will be tested, Combined test of different CPU and different capacity of RAM,
  SSD/HDDs and networking will be included too.)
- Networking bandwidth and throughput metrics
  - Metrics of Gigabit and 10 Gigabit networking 
- Filecoin software configurations
  - Sector builder and sizes under test
  - Sector loss monitoring
  - Daemon - Miner configurations
  - Sealing and Proofs metrics
  - Deal state metrics
  - Blockchain metrics
  - mined block metrics(ePoSt time)
  - Seal Worker configurations(different configuration do different job, maximum efficiency)
